    ├── README.md                    # Deployment documentation
    ├── deploy-full.sh              # Complete automated deployment pipeline
    ├── 01-build-and-test.sh        # Build Docker image and test locally
    ├── 02-push-to-ecr.sh          # Push image to AWS ECR  
    ├── 03-deploy-to-ecs.sh        # Deploy to AWS ECS Fargate
    ├── 03-deploy-to-apprunner.sh  # Deploy to AWS App Runner (alternative)
    ├── 04-test-deployment.sh      # Test deployed application

```

### 🗄️ **Archived Files**
```
└── archive/
    ├── Moved all overlapping documentation files
    ├── Moved incomplete deployment scripts
    ├── Moved unused configuration files
    └── Moved old application versions
```

## 🎯 **New Deployment Process**

### **Simple Automated Deployment:**
```bash
# 1. Setup
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# 2. Deploy everything
./deploy/deploy-full.sh
```

### **Step-by-step Deployment:**
```bash
./deploy/01-build-and-test.sh      # Build and test locally
./deploy/02-push-to-ecr.sh         # Push to AWS ECR
./deploy/03-deploy-to-ecs.sh       # Deploy to ECS (or use 03-deploy-to-apprunner.sh)
./deploy/04-test-deployment.sh     # Test the deployment
./deploy/05-cleanup-old-services.sh # Clean up old services
```

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

- ✅ **Zero-downtime deployment** - creates new services alongside existing ones
- ✅ **Local testing** before AWS deployment
- ✅ **Health checks** at each step
- ✅ **Rollback capability** - old services preserved until cleanup
- ✅ **Environment validation** - checks required variables
- ✅ **Confirmation prompts** for destructive actions

## 📊 **Benefits**

1. **Clean Structure**: No more overlapping docs and scripts
2. **Bulletproof Deployment**: Tested, automated scripts with safety checks
3. **Flexible Options**: Choose ECS Fargate or App Runner
4. **Easy Maintenance**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Production Ready**: Industry-standard deployment practices

## 🎉 **Ready for Bulletproof Deployment!**

The project is now organized for reliable, repeatable deployments with proper testing and safety measures. You can deploy new versions without taking down existing services, test thoroughly, and clean up when ready.

Next step: Test the deployment scripts with your existing AWS environment!
